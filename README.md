# Pokemon Teambuilder Algorithm
An attempt an an algorithm to automate competitive Pokemon battling team selection. I created this algorithm in January 2020.

The motivation for this project was purely from a curiosity for problem-solving. I used to play Pokemon games competitively, and one of the more interesting parts of the competitive aspect of the game was team composition. You needed to consider a lot of factors to create a solid team: typing, roles, synergy between teammates, etc. I found it really interesting that there wasn't any hard guideline you had to follow to create a good team. This interest ultimately led me to the following question: *is there such thing as the absolute best way to create a competitive team?*

This Python script is my attempt at creating the algorithm. In its current state (as of Sept. 26, 2020), it still has a lots of flaws. It's based around the most recent Pokemon games in terms of type frequency, doesn't take into account which Pokemon are/aren't competitively viable (and thus the type data isn't *quite* as applicable), and sometimes spits out weird type combinations that don't really make sense for the given matchup. It's not nearly as flexible or as in-depth as I would like it to be. But, it's a start at the very least.

I don't want to say that this repository is *archived* and I'm done with the project, because I'm not. The algorithm isn't quite what I wanted it to be, and I may return to it someday to finish it and refine it a little bit. However, I can't really guarantee that I'll return to the project and revamp it.
